## **STAR Method**

### **Situation**

Faced with disorganized sales and reference data stored across multiple sheets, I needed to create a system that connects and analyzes data efficiently to support actionable business insights.

### **Task**

The goal was to consolidate data, clean and transform it, build a relational data model, and create an interactive dashboard with automation for seamless updates.

### **Action**

1. Used **Power Query** to clean, transform, and merge data from multiple sheets into one data model.
2. Leveraged **Power Pivot** to create relationships between tables and perform advanced calculations using DAX (e.g., average shipping price per item).
3. Designed a dynamic **dashboard** with Pivot Charts and Slicers for interactive exploration of data.
4. Automated the workflow to update the entire system with a single click whenever new data is added.

### **Result**

The project resulted in:

- A robust data model linking sales and reference data seamlessly.
- Interactive dashboards providing actionable insights in real time.
- Time efficiency through automation, ensuring new data updates without manual intervention.
