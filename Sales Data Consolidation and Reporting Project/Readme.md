# Overview
This project demonstrates a systematic approach to organizing scattered sales data across multiple files with inconsistent entries and prices.
Using tools like Excel and Power Query, I streamlined the process to generate accurate and reusable monthly sales reports.

## Situation
- The task involved preparing a monthly sales report, but the available data posed significant challenges. Old sales data was scattered across various files, with discrepancies in item names, prices, and inconsistent formatting, making it difficult to generate accurate reports.

## Task
- The objective was to create a consolidated dataset that:

  Corrected inconsistencies in item names and entries.
  Consolidated sales data into a single source of truth.
  Aligned sales data with accurate pricing for future reporting.
## Action
- Reference Creation:
  - Located an old document with consistent item entries.
  - Converted the Word document to PDF and imported it into Excel.
  - Extracted tables and created a reference column with the correct entries.
Data Consolidation:

Imported old sales data using Power Query.
Appended data from multiple files and removed duplicates.
Used fuzzy matching to detect inconsistencies and manually resolved null values.
Price Sheet Integration:

Repeated the process for price sheets to ensure consistency.
Final Consolidation:

Generated a master sheet with accurate item names, monthly sales, and prices.
Result
The result was a clean, consolidated dataset that:

Improved reporting efficiency and accuracy.
Provided a reusable structure for future monthly sales reports.
Enabled better decision-making with reliable and organized data.
